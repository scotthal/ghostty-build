I am so sorry.

I know that Nix is supposed to _replace_ Docker for reproducible builds.
I _love_ the ideas behind Nix.  I don't like the global changes that the
Nix installation prodcess makes all over my system.  So I have stuffed
the entire GhosTTY Nix build setup inside a container, allowing me to
build without making those global changes to my system state.

Again, I am so, so sorry.
